# Voter-Reg.Form
Frontend Form for registering new voters 
In this project, I got a chance to rebuild the form6 used by nvsp.in for registering new voters. 
The Registration page is very straightforward and only provides functionality on the frontend part. 
The point is to make it look like the real page as much as you reasonably can.
